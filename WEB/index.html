How  does  complexity  affect  people’s  reaction  to  tax  changes?
To  answer  this  question,  we  conduct  an  experiment  in  which  subjects  work for a piece rate and face taxes.
One treatment features a simple tax  system,  the  other  a  complex  one.
Subjects’  economic  incentives  are  identical  across  treatments.
We  introduce  the  same  sequence  of  additional  taxes  in  both  treatments.
Subjects  in  the  complex  treatment underreact to new taxes; some ignore new taxes entirely.
The  underreaction  is  stronger  for  subjects  with  lower  cognitive  ability.
Contrary to predictions from models of rational inattention,subjects are equally likely to ignore large or small incentive changes.

We study how complexity influences choices.
In particular, we analyze how the complexity of the economic decision environment influences the reaction to subsequent changes in incentives.

<b>0. Greetings and Intro</b><br>
Hi, the title of the paper that I will present now is 'Complex Tax Incentives'.<br>
We can easily guess how this paper would lead its discussion forward by just reading the title. <br>
Actually I was not really intrigued bythis paper, in the first place, however, as I proceeded reading this, I found out it is pretty enjoyable, <br>
following their reasoning and through which steps they conducted this research.<br>
To tell the truth, I even thought that perhaps the purpose of this sub area of economics which called "Experimental Economics"<br>
is just to figure out how dumb we human are with concrete numbers and statistics. and also with fancy reasoning.<br>
Now, I will jump into the content.<br>
